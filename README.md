# Simple YouTube video downloader using PyTube
Hello. I´m guiperalta and this is my first Py project and first public Git project.

This basic Py script will download the best video and audio quality streams from the given YouTube URL and merge them into a single file.

This script requires PyTube and ffmpeg

Note: I´m using the regular ffmpeg, not the ffmpeg-python
### Usage
```
python easypytube.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw
```

### Any suggestions will be appreciated

## Built With
* [PyTube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) - YouTube download script
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Media converter
